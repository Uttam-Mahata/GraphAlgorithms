# GraphAlgorithms

## Overview
GraphAlgorithms is a Java project implementing various graph algorithms. It aims to provide efficient and easy-to-understand implementations for educational purposes as well as practical applications.

## Features
- Implementation of fundamental graph algorithms.
- Easy-to-use interfaces for adding and manipulating graphs.
- Comprehensive documentation for each algorithm.
  
## Algorithms Implemented
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Uttam-Mahata/GraphAlgorithms.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd GraphAlgorithms
    ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```



### Adding New Algorithms
1. Create a new Java class in the appropriate package.
2. Implement the algorithm following the structure of existing classes.
3. Update the documentation to include your new algorithm.
